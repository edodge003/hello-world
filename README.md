Hi there fantasy football fans!

Heading into MNF I have a 26 point lead on my opponent and he has Brandon Marshall playing tonight. I also get a $25 bonus for scoring the most points in the league. There is one other player that can catch me and I have a 14 point lead on him, but he has the Cardinals defense playing tonight. So, I'm hoping Brandon Marshall scores less than 26 points and the Cardinals defense scores less than 14 points. That would notch me another win and put $25 in my pocket :)
